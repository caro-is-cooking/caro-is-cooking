# 🍳 Caro is Cooking

My first project on GitHub — a minimal landing page for **caro-is-cooking**.

Open it in a browser to see a **minimal 8-bit animated scene**: dark brown page, pixel font, and a red-haired cook with green eyes making eggs in a pan. No outlines, no mouth — just flat colors, subtle motion (stirring, steam, blink), and a simple brown frame.

## What's inside

- `index.html` — main page with pixel-art canvas and caption
- `style.css` — minimal styling (dark brown background, beige text, thin frame)
- `script.js` — draws and animates the scene (cook, pan, eggs, steam; no black outlines)

## Run it locally

Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a simple local server:

```bash
# From this folder:
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```
